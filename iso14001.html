    <p><b><br>ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Management System (EMS)</b> <br><br>
      ISO 14001 is the international Environmental Management System (EMS) standard. ISO 14001:2015 was issued November 15, 2015. Changes to the new standard clarify and simplify the requirements, and align the standard with ISO 9001:2015.

    <p><b>Is ISO 14001 compliance a "requirement"?    </b><br><br>Many World Class companies are ISO 14001 certified, and "require" their partners/suppliers to also become ISO 14001 certified. Ford Motor Company requires their suppliers to be ISO 14001 certified. <br><br>

    <b>Does it help if your quality management system (QMS) is already certified?    </b><br>Your certified/accredited quality management system (QMS) (e. g., ISO 14001, ISO 17025) may be revised to also meet ISO 14001 EMS requirements! The QMS and EMS have many requirements common to both QMS and EMS including document and records control, management responsibility and review, corrective and preventive action, internal auditing, and calibration and control of measuring/monitoring devices. We think this is a smart idea!    <br><br>

    <b>What about "environmental aspects?"</b><br> The key to continual improvement in meeting ISO 14001 requirements is effective identification and ranking of all "Environmental Aspects". These aspects are then evaluated for significance. The environmental impact of "Significant Aspects" can best be reduced by targeted, effective action. <b>ISO SYSTEMS</b> have the experience and knowledge to effectively audit your facility, to identify and rank Environmental Aspects, and to reduce your firm's environmental impact.

    <br><br>
    <b>What are some of the advantages of implementing an effective EMS compliant with ISO 14001?</b>
      <ul>
      <li>Improve your competitive advantage</li><br>
      <li>Minimize the risk of an environmental incident</li><br>
      <li>Reduce the cost of waste management and disposal, save in consumption of energy and materials, lower production costs or packaging costs</li><br>
      <li>Improve your corporate image among customers, regulatory agencies, and the public</li><br>
      <li>The law may require compliance! Environmental inspectors from Federal, state, and local agencies may visit your facility at any time, often without notice</li><br>
      <li>Provide a framework for continual improvement of your environmental performance</li><br>
    </ul>
