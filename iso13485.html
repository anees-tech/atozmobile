      What is ISO 13485:2016?</b><br><br>ISO 13485 is the quality management system standard for medical devices. This standard applies the ISO 9001:2015 process approach to quality, and replaces ISO 13485:2003 and ISO 13488:1996. <br><br>
      ISO 13485:2016 provides an effective base model for compliance with the EU CE marking Medical Devices Directives (Annex II, V, VI) and Health Canada CMDCAS* (class II, III & IV devices) requirements. ISO 13485:2016 is also considered to be fully compatible with the FDA QSR. <br><br> <b>Note:</b> <br><br>National/regional regulations may allow design of devices to be excluded from the assessment activity of lower risk devices.

  <p>Your organization is very busy... everyone wears more than one hat. Time to implement a quality management system is often limited. We take less time to get you certified. Quality system implementation is a "team sport..." however, if your organization does not have the time, we can deliver a turn-key system, guaranteed to get you certified. <br><br>Our methods <b><u>never</u></b> include one-size-fits-all, "cookie-cutter" approaches. ISO 13485 quality systems requires process approaches, customer focus, and continual improvement. You cannot get that from a cookie cutter. Most importantly, our quality management systems improve your bottom line. "Cookie cutter" approaches do not work, and only add cost. <br><br>When we leave, the quality management system is yours, not ours. We provide all the knowledge and experience your organization needs to effectively manage and improve your certified QMS in the future. When we are finished, your organization owns your ISO 13485 quality management system. <br><br>ISO Systems is our association of experienced, creative, enthusiastic quality professionals committed to building and improving quality systems while permanently reducing quality costs. <br><br></p>
