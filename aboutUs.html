    <h3>Product Certification&nbsp; (CE Marking)</h3>
    <p><b>CE Marking is the symbol as</b> shown on the top of this page. The letters <b> "CE"</b> are the abbreviation
      of French phrase "Conformité Européene" which literally means "European Conformity". The term initially used was
      "EC Mark" and it was officially replaced by "CE Marking" in the Directive 93/68/EEC in 1993. "CE Marking" is now
      used in all EU official documents. "CE Mark" is also in use, but it is NOT the official term.</p>

      </b>
      manufacturer's declaration that the product complies with the
      essential requirements of the relevant European health, safety and
      environmental protection legislation, in practice by many of the

      CENELEC, etc). CEN stands for European Committee for Standardization.<br>
      CENELEC stands for European Committee for Electrotechnical

      <b>CE Marking on a product ensures the </b>free movement of the product

      <br>
      <b>CE Marking on a product permits </b>the withdrawal of the
      non-conforming products by customs and enforcement/vigilance
      authorities.
