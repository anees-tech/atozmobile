    <p>EUREP, 'Euro Retailer Produce Working Group', is a platform of leading retailers in Europe active in the retail
      business of the agricultural food industry. ''GAP'' stands for 'Good Agricultural Practice', a minimum production
      standard for a good agricultural practice of agricultural products. <br><br> Since 2008 the official name EUREPGAP
      is changed into GLOBALGAP. The new standard GLOBALGAP IFA is a global accepted food safety standard for retailers.
      Globalgap uses GAP as a production standard for the certification of good agricultural practice in the and
      includes certification for agricultural, animal and aquaculture production.<br><br> Globalgap is based on the
      principles of risk prevention, risk analysis and HACCP, sustainable agriculture by means of Integrated Pest
      Management (IPM) and Integrated Crop Management (ICM), using existing technologies for the continuous improvement
      of farming systems.<br><br> Technically speaking, Globalgap is a set of normative documents suitable to be
      accredited to internationally recognised certification criteria such as ISO Guide 65. Representatives from around
      the globe and all stages of the food chain have been involved in the development of these documents. In addition
      the views from stakeholders outside the Industry including consumer and environmental organisations and
      governments have helped shape the protocols. This wide consultation has produced a robust and challenging but
      nonetheless achievable protocol which farmers around the world can use to demonstrate compliance with Good
      Agricultural Practices. The standards are openly available and free to obtain from the Globalgap website.<br><br>
      Globalgap members include retailers, producers/farmers and associate members from the input and service side of
      agriculture. The work of the Committees is supported by Food PLUS, a not-for-profit limited company based in
      Cologne, Germany. <br><br><br> <b>Global GAP IFA</b> <br> Crops Base : Fruit & Vegetables, Combinable crops,
