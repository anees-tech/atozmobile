  <p><b>ISO 22000 / FSSC 22000 /HACCP / HALAL Food Safety Management System</b> <br>
  <br> To meet the growing food safety and quality requirements, companies must ensure that their supply chain is secured and under appropriate controls. Organizations are taking more ownership for food safety and protecting their brands.

  <p><b>WHAT IS FSSC 22000 CERTIFICATION?</b> <br> <br> FSSC 22000:2010 is an International Standard developed for the certification of Food Safety Management Systems for food manufacturers.<br> <br>It combines the requirements of ISO 22000:2018 (Food Safety Management Systems requirements) and PASS220:2008 (prerequisite programmes on food safety for food manufacturing).<br> <br>The FSSC 22000:2010 scheme is fully recognized by the Global Food Safety Initiative (GSFI), the benchmarking body for the harmonization of international food safety standards, along with other food safety management schemes like the BRC, IFS and SQF schemes. The strong element of ISO 22000:2018 in the standard makes it align with other generic management systems such as the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001 to enable effective system integration.</p>

  <p><b>WHAT IS ISO 22000 CERTIFICATION?</b> <br> <br> Increasing consumer demand for safe food has led many companies to develop both food quality and safety management systems, based on the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP). In 2001, ISO started the development on an auditable standard, which further defines HACCP's role in food safety management systems and culminated in the newly formed ISO 22000. The ISO 22000 standard intends to define the food safety management requirements for companies that need to meet and exceed food safety regulations all over the world. One standard that encompasses all the consumer and market needs. It speeds and simplifies processes without compromising other quality or safety management systems.
  <br><br>ISO 22000 is an international certification standard that defines the requirements of food safety management systems. It can be used by all organisations, in the supply chain - from farmers to food services, to processing, transportation, storage, retail and packaging. <br><br> ISO 22000 creates a harmonised safety standard that's accepted the world over. By integrating multiple principals, methodologies and applications, ISO 22000 is easier to understand, apply and recognise. That makes it more efficient and effective as an entry-to-market tool than previous combinations of national standards.

  <h4> 
    ISO 22000 specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that combines well-recognized key elements to ensure food safety along the food chain, up to the point of final consumption:
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Provide interactive 
    communication, internationally and across the supply chain.
    </li>
    <li>Compliance with the HACCP principles - Hazard Analysis, Identify Critical Control Points (CCP's), Establish Critical Links, Monitor CCP's, Establish Corrective 
    Action, Record Keeping, Verification.</li>
    <li>Harmonise the voluntary and 
    prerequisite standards.</li>
    <li>Create a structure that's aligned

  <p><b>Food safety as an objective</b> Food safety is a global concern. Past events have demonstrated that weak food controls can dramatically impact our day to day lives and turn the fortunes of successful companies around. Pressure from consumers, ecological associations and governmental bodies is now driving the whole food supply chain (primary producers, catering establishments, restaurants, hotels, food producing companies, food transporting companies, retailers, food storing companies and animal feed manufacturers) to implement safer food management systems.</p>

  <p>HACCP is used by an organization to demonstrate its capability to meet customer requirements for product and / or service and for assessment of that capability internally and/or externally.</p>

  <h3>Process Approach</h3>
  <p>Encourages adoption of process approach to quality management. Systematic identification and management of processes employed and interactions between such processes. Recognizes that customer plays a significant role in defining requirements as inputs.</p>
